# A simple Weather App Built using React Js and Redux

My React weather app is fairly simple and makes use of a few outside components including React-Google-Maps and sparklines for generating the map and bar graphs that show a line through the average temperature, which is displayed beneath the charts showing how much above or below the average the next five days Temperature, pressure, and humidity will be. Put the name of your or any city in America to check the weather!
